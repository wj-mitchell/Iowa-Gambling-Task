# Iowa Gambling Task

This is a version of the Iowa Gambling Task programmed in Python that I am developing to use in combination with Study 4 outlined within Project 31297 of my [Neuro_Uncertainty Reposity](https://github.com/wj-mitchell/Neuro_Uncertainty). 

## Description
The task is mostly self-contained within the `Task.py` file. I have been running it through PsychoPy Runner, though it doesn't currently contain any PsychoPy code. Upon starting, you are prompted to enter a PID formatted as `DD-####` in line with the needs of our specific study; though this is simple to modify for your own purposes. Keep in mind if you do modify it, that it's designed to validate the PID according to that format, so be sure to change that as well. The task presents four card decks arranged in a square. Selecting any card deck requires pressing the A, B, C, or D key on your keyboard. Once that occurs, the image of the card will be replaced by another with a glow around it, to signify the subject's choice. Feedback regarding wins and losses appears at the center of the screen for 3 seconds before the next choice can be made. A net score is visible throughout the task in the upper right corner. The endowment subjects begin with is $2000. The total number of trials is 100, in line with 

All images of the card decks are contained within the `assets` directory. Each deck has a `_selected` and `_unselected` .png image. The glow that defines the `_selected` .png images was generated within and exported from Microsoft Powerpoint. 

The data generated by the task exports to the `data` directory and should output once the task ends, regardless of whether the task was completed. Additionally, a summary of task choices is output to the window in which it is ran (i.e., PsychoPy Runner, Python Terminal, etc.). The outputted data includes the trial numbers, the rewards and penalties for each trial, and which deck subjects selected during each trial.

## TO-DO:
* Add labels to the card decks
* Reduce the wait time from 3 seconds to 2 seconds
* Add a start screen
* Add an instruction screen
* Adjust win and loss probabilities.
* Add a time variable to indicate how long each trial took
* Create fixed reward schedules
* Randomize decks and reward schedules
* Limit selection of any given deck to 40 selections
* Review the relevant literature and confirm that this manifestation of the task is compliant with previous standards
